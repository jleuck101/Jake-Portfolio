    <p>The goal for this project was to create a horror short film, working with a team. Roles were loosely defined, and everyone got a chance to rotoscope and contribute to shots.
    I am responsible for developing the overall look of the demon, as well as on-set responsibilities, editing the short, and devising a solution for the extraction of EXR image sequences from the container .mts format, and setup of a repeatable workflow by using the cloud-native filesystem Suite, allowing anyone to work on the project from anywhere.</p>

    <p>This was a large experimental undertaking for what is my first Nuke project, allowing me to get more comfortable with what can be done with nothing but an alpha matte and a clean plate. 
    One challenge faced was creating a solution that was not only viable for a single-frame look, as the original gizmos used were not animatable, leaving the creature effects stagnant throughout the scene. 
    To aid with this, I experimented with layered noise-driven distortion, organic edge gizmos, motion blur, and time-echo effects until a balance was achieved between the demon's core, edges, and glow that were satisfying.</p>
