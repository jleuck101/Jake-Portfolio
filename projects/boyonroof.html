      This project included taking a camera tracked CG environment and placing an actor on a greenscreen on the roof of a building.
      For the actor, a proper key of the plate was necessary, which was then stabilized and tracked into the scene.
      Color corrections were made to the background, actor, and CG environment to better incorporate them into a cohesive scene.
      Volumetric rays were added, driven by the combined matte of the unified plates.
