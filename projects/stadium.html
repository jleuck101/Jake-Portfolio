    <p>This project simply required the combination of multiple plates (Greenscreen, BG, Far BG) into one final, cohesive image. I keyed out the player, as well as a luma keyer to cut out the original sky. Roto shapes were used to fill in necessary gaps. The largest part of this project was the rotopaint for the sign replacement. I had a desire to make a completely clean plate with both stadium signs removed, so I studied the simple patterns, which helped train my eye for small details such as chromatic aberration, how pixels blend together, and very subtle lighting discrepancies. I then replaced the upper stadium sign with a small nod to those that lost their jobs in the recent closure of Technicolor.</p>
