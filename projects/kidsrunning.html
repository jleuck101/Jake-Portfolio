    <p>This project involved taking a plate of a street and beautifying it by mirroring the more visually interesting building on the right.
      Accomplishing this required an understanding that in order to matchmove the mirrored plate correctly, it would first need to be stabilized. This was achieved by frameholding the tracked camera rather than the projected plate, which was then cut out, mirrored, and tracked back in.
      Additional color corrections and emhancements were made, such as the addition of volume rays. </p>
