        <p>
          I'm Jake â€” a Nuke Compositor and Visual Effects student at DePaul University with minors in animation and computer science.</p>

          Congratulations! You found one of the only pictures where I'm not smiling. I am an avid problem solver. Any challenge that comes my way that isn't working perfectly, I can't help myself but to learn every little thing about it. Lucky for me, I stumbled upon the world of Visual Effects, where the problems are endless (I say with love).</p>
  
          <p>Starting with YouTube content in 2021, I quickly grew from "shorts editor" to "high effort meme creator" to "Resolve Fusion Compositor". Once I finally got my hands on Nuke at DePaul in the fall of last year, I have fallen in love with the ability to control and manipulate digital imagery with complete clarity and precision. It has allowed me to develop a better eye for the world, understanding how we perceive all that's around us. I love being able to lend my hand to tell exciting stories, and bring a smile to as many people as I can, whether they enjoyed my work, or enjoyed working with me.     <a href="../contact.html">Contact Page.</a></p>
