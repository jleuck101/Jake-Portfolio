          <h3>Hi, I'm Jake!</h3>
          <p>I’m a passionate <strong>compositor</strong> specializing in <strong>motion graphics</strong>, <strong>VFX</strong>, and <strong>3D compositing</strong>. I enjoy combining my creative vision with technical skills to bring ideas to life. Currently, I’m working with tools like <strong>Nuke</strong> and <strong>After Effects</strong> to produce compelling visual effects for various projects.</p>

          <p>My journey began in [Year] when I first started experimenting with visual effects and film production. Since then, I’ve had the pleasure of working on <strong>advertisements</strong>, <strong>short films</strong>, and <strong>music videos</strong>, constantly refining my craft and pushing creative boundaries.</p>

          <p>I’m always open to exciting opportunities, and I love collaborating with other creatives to bring their vision to life. If you’d like to work together, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">reach out</a>!</p>
